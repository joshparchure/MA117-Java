/*
 * PROJECT 0
 *
 * This file is a SKELETON file. It has a SMALL set of test to check some features of 
 * the FRACTIONS class.  The BOSS system will test ALL parts of your solution.
 * You must create your own tests.
 * 
 * Tasks:
 *
 * 1) Create your own tests for the FRACTIONS class 
 *
 * 2) Fill in the following fields:
